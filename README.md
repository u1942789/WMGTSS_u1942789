Repository of the coursework for assignment 2 of SDLC.

The ".idea" file is needed for the PyCharm IDE that I used when developing the code.
It should not be needed to run the code, and it should not affect the code.

# Python Libraries Needed:
- from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, render_template, request, session, flash
- from datetime import datetime
- import sqlite3
- import pytest

# Account Permissions
There are 2 tutor/admin accounts set up, and new admin accounts cannot be added currently.
This is important to the Q&A boards as only tutors can create Q&A boards and answer questions.

- Username: Tutor1
- Password: pass


- Username: Tutor2
- Password: word

All other new accounts created will not be given admin permissions.

Two other student accounts also exist:

- Username: Student1
- Password: 1111

- Username: Student2
- Password: 2222
